# Module: Project 3
# Assignment:  Project 3 will bring the breadth of knowledge that you have acquired in this class and allow you to create almost anything you want. 
# Using any of the skills weâ€™ve used thus far, or any of the skills you are working with in other classes, build a project that either builds on the previous projects, or is it's own thing.
