# Project 3
#### Tkinter Ball Game
I wrote this becasue I like having fun with my projects, so the idea was to create a game for my final project. The previous projects I wrote did not use GUI's so I wanted to create a GUI for this project. I did research and found Tkinter. What is Tkinter? Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.<br>  
**Rules:** The rules of the game are simple, once you start the script, it will open a window with you being a ball. Your objective is to see how many random size and spaced walls you're able to jump over using your spacebar.<br>  
**Instructions:** To run this script click on [My Repository](https://github.com/uc-svintsjr/it3038c-scripts "My Repository") and download my repository via zip folder. <br>
Once you've download my repository, the zipped folder will be in your downloads directory in file explorer, unzip the folder to your desktop. The file path of the game.py file is **`...\it3038c-scripts\Project3\game.py`**. Once you locate the game.py file, double click it, and Visual Studio will open the script.<br>  
Before you try running this script, you will have to install these modules.
```
pip install numpy
pip install tkinter
pip intall keyboard
```
Now that you have the file open in Visual Studio and have all the modules installed press **`Ctrl+ F5`** to run the script.<br><br> Visual Studio will prompt a window saying **`"Do you trust the authors of the files in this workspace`"**. You will click **`"Trust Workspace & Continue"`**. Lastly, Visual Studio will prompt a second window saying **`"You don't have an extension for debugging Python"`**. *"Should we find a Python extension in the Marketplace"*. Click **`"Find Python extension`"**. In the bottom right corner of Visual Studio it will have a window saying **`"Python extension is now installed"`**. You're now ready to play the game!<br>
